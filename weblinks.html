<h3>This is a link list for a WebApp that shows you live the tweets around your location (or around a certain location). It helps you to find out what’s happening around you, so you can choose what interesting to do next.</h3>

<p><strong>Dream Version</strong></br>On a website there is big map (Open Street Map or Google Map). The map shows where I am (permission of location of my computer is given) and automatically shows live tweets (maybe also instagram pictures) taken around my location on the map from the last 2 hours. On top of the map there is a time picker. By default it’ set by 2 hours. I can enter a different time period by sliding on the time picker. There is also a refresh button on the right side of the tiem picker. If I press it, the tweets on the map load again and tweets created in the meantime are shown plus tweets longer ago then 2 hours vanish. 

</br></br><strong>Alternative</strong></br> (if this is all to complicated for me):
On the top left corner of a website there is an input field with a hint that sais “Search”, that I can activate by clicking into it. It’s appearance changes when it’s activated (blue border-color) and I can type in my location. If my input is valid (address is valid) the box’s border turnes green and I can press return. After I pressed return all twitter posts + their location from the last 2 hours around 5 km of my typed in address are shown in a masonry grid.</p>
